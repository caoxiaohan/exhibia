/*
*
* Thank you for purchasing EasyAjax_Form. 
* 
* Please review the following notes before implementing into your project.  
* Your form will work well without changing a thing but I designed this tool
* so every designer could make it their own. 
*
* Make sure not to change the selector names of the required CSS rules 
* (.FAIL, #FORM_LOAD, etc) but feel free to test away with 
* new delcarations (property:value;).  If you would like to change the 
* selector names, see the advanced customization options in the 
* documentation.
