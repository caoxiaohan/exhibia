webmail access to IMAP accounts and has very few requirements to install.
Features multi-language support, simple contacts manager, MIME attachments,
displays HTML messages. W3MAIL supports leading open-source database engines,
PostgreSQL and MySQL. The lastest version of this document can be obtained
from http://w3mail.sf.net

Requirements
============

These are the following requirements to use W3MAIL:

    * OS: Linux, Windows all 
    * WWW Server: Apache 1.3 or better 
    * PHP: The latest version PHP with the IMAP extensions.
    * MySQL or PostgreSQL database engine

Installation
============

1. Obtaining and installing W3MAIL

First fetch the W3MAIL sources, and put them into a web-accessible location,
default - /home/httpd/sites/webmail.

2. Setting up IMAP

Three open-source IMAP servers are available now: University of Washington
(UW), Cyrus IMAP, and Courier IMAP. Setting up procedure depends a lot on
the server your choose. See the documentation that comes with your server
to install it. We strongly recommend you to use the UW IMAP server.

3. Installing and configuring Apache webserver

Install the Apache webserver and lastest version of PHP. Then go into your
webserver configuration and make the following changes to execute W3MAIL:

Alias /mail /home/httpd/sites/webmail/

<Directory "/home/httpd/sites/webmail/">
    Options ExecCGI
    AllowOverride all
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

If your webserver does not already have PHP you must configure it to work with
PHP. You can find PHP at http://www.php.net. See the documentation that comes
with PHP for instructions how to set it up.

4. Enable the PHP IMAP extensions

You must also enabled the IMAP extensions in PHP to use this program.
First make sure that the extensions are compiled acording to the PHP documents.
Then, open you php.ini file and find a line (if you compiled the extensions as
a seperate module) that reades ;extension=imap.so or ;extension=php_imap.dll
if you are running your webserwer under Windows, and remove the ";" from in
front of the line. Then restart your web-server if necessary.

5. Configuration

Go into your php.ini file and find a setting called "File Uploads". Then find
the file_uploads parameter and set it to On. Here to define the maximum
allowed size for uploaded files also. Restart your web-server if necessary
and browse to http://www.example.com/mail/ to continue your installation.

Configuration parameters

Most of the W3MAIL configuration parameters are controlled by the config.php
script.
