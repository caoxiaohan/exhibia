############################### PENNY AUCTION SOTWARE USER PAGES #################################################


This Folder contains the default layouts ALL TEMPLATES

If the template you are using has a record for the page you are looking for in

<SERVER ROOT>/include/<TEMPLATE>/<YOUR PAGE>/ 



then you need to do your edits there, infact the preferred place to make
these edits IS IN THAT FOLDER....these files are loaded by our flagship templates
such as falconbids, or pas-flagship as well as sticky, wavee and a few others
if you wish to modify one of these template's user pages then move the file you 
wish to edit to the user_pages folder inside that template(create the folder if
it does not exist) and the new page when you refrsh will in fact be the content
that you are working on


User Pages
mydetails, myaccount etc etc
Are all stored in the cusom folder mentioned before in a subfolder titled 'user_pages'


Product Pages
buybids.php, buyitnow.php etc etc
Are all stored in a sub folder titled 'product_pages'

AGAIN WE RECCOMEND MAKING ALL EDITS TO YOUR TEMPLATE INSIDE THE CUSTOM FOLDER SPECIFIC TO YOUR TEMPLATE
IF FOLDERS DO NTO EXIST IN THE APPROPRIATE PLACES THEN CREATE THEM

include/

    include/user_pages
    include/prooduct_pages
    (above are the default pages for our flagship templates)
    
   include/<TEMPLATE>/ (<TEMPLATE> == your chosen template)
	  include/user_pages
	  include/prooduct_pages
	  (these are your template speciific files...beware not all files files may have a custom entry in this file...but if it does not then
	  simply copy the default file mentioned before to your template folder)
	  
	  
	  
EXAMPLE

You wish to customize http://example.com/index.php for the "PAS flagship" template

index.php is a special psuedo case in this instance handled by main.php

you would find it in include/pas/main.php 
if this file does not exist for your template then you would copy it from include/main.php to include/pas/main.php 

AUCTION BOXES ARE FAR EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE BY EDITING THE CSS...ALL AUCTION BOXES ARE HANDLED BY THE CLASS 'auction-item'
THE ONES ARRANGED HORIZONTALLY ARE HANDLED BY THE CSS ID => '#horizontal-auctions-box' VERTICAL ONES ARE CONTROLLED BY => '#vertical-auctions-box'








AUCTION BOXES 

IN MOST CASES THE AUCTION BOXES ARE WITHIN THE FILES FOR THE TEMPLATE EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE THEY ARE AN ADDON(WE HOPE TO SOON OFFER SUPPORT
FOR MIXING AND MATCHING AUCTION BOXES, ICONS AND MORE)
