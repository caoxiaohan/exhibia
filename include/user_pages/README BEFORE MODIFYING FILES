############################### PENNY AUCTION SOTWARE USER PAGES #################################################


This Folder contains the default layouts of logged in user pages

If the template you are using has a record for the page you are looking for in

<SERVER ROOT>/include/<TEMPLATE>/user_pages/<YOUR PAGE>/ 

then you need to do your edits there, infact the preferred place to make
these edits IS IN THAT FOLDER....these files are loaded by our flagship templates
such as falconbids, or pas-flagship as well as sticky, wavee and a few others
if you wish to modify one of these template's user pages then move the file you 
wish to edit to the user_pages folder insode that template(create the folder if
it does not exist) and the new page when you refrsh will in fact be the content
that you are working on
